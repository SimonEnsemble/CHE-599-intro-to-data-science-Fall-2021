# A/B testing

> In modern data analytics, deciding whether two numerical samples come from the same underlying distribution is called A/B testing. The name refers to the labels of the two samples, A and B. [source](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/12/1/AB_Testing.html)

background reading: [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/12/1/AB_Testing.html), on which this notebook is heavily inspired.

!!! example \"problem set up: A/B test\"
	we wish to design a controlled study to answer the question: does treating cauliflower plants with fertilizer affect the mass of their heads?

	consider a large population of cauliflower (\"cauli\") plants on a farm, all planted at the same time. we randomly select a set of cauli plants on the farm to \"enroll\" in our A/B test.

	in a controlled study, we randomly allocate each cauli plant to one of two groups: (A) the _control group_ or (B) the _treatment group_.
	  * cauli plants in the treatment group are fertilized weekly.
	  * cauli plants in the control group are never fertilized.

	at harvest, we measure the mass (in grams) of each cauliflower head in the two groups. 

	the _goal_ of this A/B test is to determine if the distribution of masses of cauliflower heads in the treatment group differs from the distribution of masses in the control group.

!!! note \"remark on causality\"
	in this _controlled study_, the cauli's were randomly assigned to the control and treatment groups. consequently, we can attribute a difference in the distribution of masses between the two groups as evidence that the fertilizer *caused* the difference.

	in contrast, if this were instead _an observational study_, the decisions about which cauli's to treat with fertilizer are not random. as a consequence of this selection bias, a difference in the distribution of masses among fertilized versus unfertilized cauli's in an observational study could be due to confounding variables instead of the variable of fertilizer treatment. e.g. farmers who chose to use fertilizer could have been compensating for poor-quality soil.

	for more on causality, see [here](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/02/causality-and-experiments.html) and [here](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/02/3/establishing-causality.html).

!!! warning \"don't jump to conclusions yet!\"
	the difference in means between the control and treatment groups _could_ be due to chance, owing to the random process of allocating the cauliflowers to the control and treatment groups!

	we only have 20 cauli in each group, a tiny subset of the entire population of cauli's on the farm. 

	by chance, in our random allocation of cauli's to the control and treatment groups, we could have happened to select cauli's that e.g. harbor extra growth genes for the treatment group. or maybe a few cauli's in the control group happened to be attacked by pests during the experiment. many factors besides the fertilizer treatment could have caused this difference in means among the groups.

❓❓❓ how confident are we that the difference in the distribution of masses between the control and treatment groups is not due to chance?

✏ to formalize, we have two possible hypotheses:

**null hypothesis**: in the population of cauli plants, the distribution of masses of cauli heads grown with fertilizer treatment is the same as the distribution for caulis that do not receive fertilizer. the difference in the distributions we see above is due to chance.

**alternative hypothesis**: in the population of cauli plants, fertilized cauli heads tend to be heavier than unfertilized cauli heads. the difference in the means (a measure of central tendency) we see above is not due to chance.

✏ we now design a **test statistic**, which (i) maps our data set to a single number, (ii) expresses the difference in outcome between the A and B groups, and (iii) would differ under the null and alternative hypothesis. 

e.g. *test statistic* := (mean mass of cauli heads in the fertilizer treatment group) - (mean mass of cauli heads in the control group)

!!! note \"the test statistic is a random variable.\"
    if we could repeat the cauli A/B test over and over, there would be different allocations of the cauli plants (which harbor variation in genes, soil they are planted in, proximity to a bug nest, etc.) to the control and treatment groups. consequently, the difference in the mean masses between the control and treatment group would vary from experiment to experiment. 

	in general, the test statistic expressing the difference between the distribution of some outcome between the two groups varies from experiment to experiment because of the randomness of allocating the samples to the A and B groups.

!!! example \"a permutation test\"
	a permutation test is a Monte Carlo simulation to answer the question: 
	> if we were to repeat the A/B test over and over, what is the probability that we would observe a test statistic (which expresses the difference between the A and B group) equal to or more extreme than we did, given that the null hypothesis is true? 
	in the permuation tests, we:
	* compute the test statistic expressing the difference between the A and B group _for our observed sample of data_. conceptually, this observed test statistic is one of many possible values we could see if we were to repeat the same experiment over and over, each time randomly allocating subjects (cauli's here) to the A or B group (controlor treatment groups here).
	* simulate the repetition of this experiment by randomly re-allocating subjects (cauli's here) to the A and B groups (control and treatment group here), _assuming that the null hypothesis is true_, to obtain the distribution of the test statistic _under the null hypothesis_. the \"under the null hypothesis\" is important because we know the outcome if we switched which group any given subject was allocated to: the outcome would be the same! if we did not operate under the assumption \"the null hypothesis is true\", we would be stuck because we could not simulate the experiment.
	* from this distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis, compute the probability that we would observe a test statistic equal to or more extreme than the test statistic we actually observed if the null hypothesis were true. this is the **p-value**.

so if the *p-value* is 0.05, this tells us, if we could repeat this experiment many times, each time randomly allocating cauli's to the control and treatment groups, *and* if fertilizer treatment has *no* effect whatsover on the mass of the cauliflower, then in 5% of the experiments, we would see the difference in means of the masses as large as it is or larger.

so if the *p-value* is small, that means that it is unlikely that the difference in means we see is due only to the random allocation of the cauli's to the two groups. thus it must be likely that the difference in means is due to a different underlying distribution of masses among cauliflowers treated with fertilizier and those that are not.

> Null hypothesis testing is a reductio ad absurdum argument adapted to statistics. In essence, a claim is assumed valid if its counter-claim is improbable. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value)

see [this interactive visualization of a permutation test on alpacas](https://www.jwilber.me/permutationtest/).

🐸 write a function `μ_mass` that takes in as arguments:
* `df_cauli::DataFrame`: the cauli `DataFrame` from the experiment
* `group_col_name::Symbol`: the name of the column in `df_cauli` that contains the group names for `filter`ing (we will need capability this later)
* `which_group::String` the group (\"control\" or \"treatment\")
and returns the mean mass of cauliflowers falling in the group `which_group`.

**permuatation test**

*idea*: randomly permute the group labels to simulate the test statistic under the null hypothesis

how do we simulate a repetition of this random experiment and obtain its test statistic (= difference in mean masses between fertilized and control cauli's) under the null hypothesis?

*key insight*: under the null hypothesis, the mass of the cauliflower head is not affected by the treatment. so, during repititions of this random experiment, the masses of all 40 cauliflowers in our data set would be the same as we see in the current data, regardless of the group to which each cauliflower was (randomly) allocated. so, the group to which the cauliflower is allocated is totally inconsequential! therefore, _under the null hypothesis_, we can simulate a repitition of our random experiment by maintaining a list of 40 cauliflowers whose masses are the same as in the data, but with their group labels (control/fertilizer) randomly *permuted*.

🐸 simulate the repeated random experiment under the null hypothesis by making a new column `:shuffled_group` in your cauli data frame that denotes the group to which the cauliflower plant (with the same mass) is allocated in the _simulated_ repetition of the experiment under the null hypothesis.

the `:mass` column remains the same since, under the null hypothesis, the mass of the cauliflower is not affected by fertilizer. the `:shuffled_group` should be a random permutation of the `:group` column in the original experiment.

!!! hint
    use the `shuffle` function (see [docs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Random/#Random.shuffle))

🐸 check that the test statistic is different in your simulation (unless we happen to assing the cauliflowers to the same group, which is very unlikely), using `μ_treat_minus_μ_control` you wrote above and your new group column name `:shuffled_group`.

!!! note
    this is why we included `group_col_name::Symbol` as an argument to `μ_mass`. it can compute the mean mass in the actual and shuffled groups.

**obtaining the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis**

🐸 simulate repetitions of the random experiment under the null hypothesis 10000 times. in an array, store the test statistic (difference in means among the two groups) for each simulation. plot the distribution of the test statistic as a histogram. 

draw a vertical line via `axvline` to indicate where the *actual*, observed test statistic falls compared to the distribution of test statistics under the null hypothesis.

!!! hint
    overwrite the `:shuffled_group` column in your cauli data frame inside a loop over simulations.

🐸 is it a coincidence that the simulated distribution of the test statistic is centered around zero?

!!! hint
    no! under the null hypothesis, there is no difference between the masses of cauli's treated with fertilizier and not treated with fertilizer.

🐸 the **p-value** is the proportion of simulated experiments under the null hypothesis where the test statistic (difference in means) was equal to or greater than what we observed in the actual experiment. compute the p-value from your simulation. let this be a one-sided hypothesis test, where our alternative hypothesis is that the fertilized caulis tend to be heavier than unfertilized caulis.

you have used a powerful computational technique (a simulation!) to test a hypothesis called a **random permutation test**. in contrast to other _parametric_ methods for hypothesis testing, the random permutation test is _empirical_ and does not impose strict assumptions about the shape of the underlying distributions (e.g. Gaussian-ness).

the **level of statistical significance** $\alpha$ is a [subjective] quantity set by researchers before the study for how small the p-value has to be to reject their null hypothesis and declare the result *statistically significant*. often $\alpha := 0.05$. in other words, $\alpha$ is the probability that we would reject the null hypothesis, given that it is true. in this context, $\alpha$ is the probability that, from our data analysis, we would conclude that fertilizer treatment tends to increase the mass of cauliflower heads, yet the truth is that fertilizer has no effect on the mass of the cauliflower head.

the Twitter thread below is a great discussion on the distinction between statistical significance and practical significance.
