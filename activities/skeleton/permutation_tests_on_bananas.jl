💡 **modifying the Cavendish banana to make it more resistant to Panama disease**

the Cavendish [banana is threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/05/science-search-for-a-super-banana-panama-disease-gm-gene-editing) by Panama disease, caused by a fungus (if interested, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkI3zkQ4WBo&t)). 
researchers wish to genetically modify the Cavendish banana plant to make it resistant to Panama disease.

🔨 **an A/B test to determine if gene editing provides resistance to Panama disease**

suppose we identified a gene in the banana plant, gene X, that might be associated with resistance to fungal infection. using modern gene editing tools, we can make precise edits to the DNA sequence of gene X that appears in the wild. the hope is that this mutated version of gene X will confer protection to the banana plant against fungal infection. 

here, we performed a randomized, controlled experiment to test if the mutated gene X confers greater resistance to Panama disease.

we first randomly select 60 banana plants and randomly allocate each to one of two groups:
* control group: banana plants we leave unmodified, harboring the wild gene X.
* treatment group: banana plants we modify, to harbor the mutated gene X.
none of these plants have been exposed to the fungus that causes Panama disease.

then, we expose each plant in the experiment to the fungus that causes Panama disease. the plants are all contained in a single greenhouse. 

after one year, we record whether or not each banana plant has been infected with Panama disease. the study is \"blind\" because the caretakers of the plants were never told which plants are genetically modified and which are not. this minimizes the chances that the caretakers (advertently or inadvertently) treat the two different variants of plants differently and thereby bias the outcome of the experiment.

⬛ the results of our randomized experiment are in `banana_AB_test_results.csv` [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimonEnsemble/CHE-599-intro-to-data-science-Fall-2021/master/data/banana_AB_test_results.csv). 
* each row represents a banana plant. 
* the `:modified` attribute is `true` if gene X in the banana plant was modified and `false` otherwise. 
* the `:infected` attribute indicates the outcome of the experiment; this attribute is `true` if the banana plant was ultimately infected and `false` otherwise. 

🍌 read in `banana_AB_test_results.csv` as a `DataFrame`, `df`.

🍌 use the `combine` function to (i) group the banana plants in `df` by genetic variant and (ii) create a new `DataFrame`, `df_outcome`, with a new column, named `p_infected`, that contains the proportion of plants of that variant that were infected by the fungus.

i.e. create a dataframe, `df_outcome`:
```
     modified      p_infected
       false          ...
       true           ...

🍌 to visualize the outcome of the A/B test, use your data frame `df_outcome` to draw a bar plot where:
* thare are two bars, one for modified banana plants and one for unmodified banana plants.
* the height of each bar represents the respective proportion of banana plants of that genetic variant that were infected by the fungus. 
* label your x-axis, y-axis, and x-ticks, and make the two bars two different colors colors.
* since proportions lie in $[0,1]$ set the y-axis limits from 0 to 1 to give perspective.

* group A: to be genetically modified
* group B: to be left unmodified

under the null hypothesis, the outcome of whether or not any given banana plant was infected would be the same regardless of the group to which the banana plant was allocated. thus, we can simulate a repitition of this random sampling and allocation by randomly permuting the labels in the `:modified` column of `df`.

simulate one repetition of the banana study, _operating under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true_, by permuting the `:modified` column, which effectively simulates the random allocation of healthy banana plants to the two groups. assign the permuted labels to be a new column in `df` called `:shuffled_modified`.

🍌 if the level of significance is set at $\alpha=0.05$, you may have the tendency to make a bold conclusion, such as \"mutating gene X confers resistance to fungal infection\" or \"mutating gene X does not influence the susceptibility to fungal infection\". however, such \"dichotomization\" is a mis-interpretation of the p-value. we must embrace uncertainty! see [this recent article in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9) where, owing to the tendency to misinterpret p-values, some scientists call for abandoning the notion of statistical significance. when you've read the article, change the `Bool` below to `true`, and question (9) is complete! 

❗ more, statistical significance does not imply the effect is large!
